# Draft-GIS-Assignment-Files
Materials to accompany a student assignment that I completed for my postgraduate studies at the University of Western Australia in October 2024.

# What this project does
It contains an ArcGIS notebook (.ipynb file) written in Python, with 2 input shape files for running a spatial analysis to investigate historical changes over time in 2 indices of spectral reflectance in an estuary. The satellite imagery (high resolution 32-bit float TIFF rasters) are not provided, so would need to be independently sourced (see ESRI StoryMap for details). It requires access to ArcGIS Pro software to run the script, although for those interested, a print of the code may be viewed in the enclosed PDF file. Specifically, this project makes the accompanying materials to an ESRI StoryMap available. The StoryMap presentation can be viewed at this URL: https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/7132fdded9de4d5e8e31a061d0f0051c

# Advice for users
This material is intended to provide access to the Python script when viewing the StoryMap presentation. Importantly, this analysis is of spectral reflectance imagery only, done for the purposes of a student assignment, which has not been peer-reviewed or subject to ground-truth validation, so results must be treated with caution.
