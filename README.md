# Draft-GIS-Assignment-Files
Materials to accompany an assignment that I have submitted for assessment.

# What this project does
It contains an ArcGIS notebook (.ipynb file) with 2 input shape files for running a spatial analysis to investigate historical changes over time in 2 indices of spectral reflectance in an estuary. It requires access to ArcGIS Pro software to run, although for those interested, a print of the code may be viewed in the enclosed PDF file. Specifically, this project makes the accompanying materials to an ESRI StoryMap (not provided here) available. I may decide to make the StoryMap publicly available, after the assignment has been graded.

# Advice for users
Apologies, but this material is not intended to be used by others at this stage (except by those assessing my university assignment). So please use / refer to this material at your own risk :-)
